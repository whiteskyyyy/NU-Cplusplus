## About

`NU-Cplusplus` is a personal archive of my academic journey in C++ programming. Each folder represents a specific activity or set of related concepts, demonstrating my understanding and implementation of different C++ fundamentals. This repository is a testament to the skills and knowledge acquired during my time at National University.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder typically corresponding to a specific programming concept or exercise. Here's a breakdown of the current structure:

* **`CIN`**: Contains code examples related to input operations in C++ using `cin`.
* **`COUT`**: Focuses on output operations in C++ using `cout`.
* **`FLOWCHART`**: Likely contains code or examples demonstrating the implementation of logic derived from flowcharts.
* **`IF STATEMENT - reuploaded with evidence`**: Demonstrates the use of `if` statements for conditional logic, possibly including revisions or additional proof of functionality.
* **`IFACTIVITY-MALE-FEMALE`**: Specific activity related to conditional statements, likely involving gender-based logic.
* **`NUMBER SYSTEM`**: Code examples pertaining to different number systems or conversions.

## Key Topics Covered

This repository covers fundamental C++ programming topics, including but not limited to:

* Basic Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)
* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
* Program Flow and Logic (as demonstrated by flowcharts)
* Data Handling (implied by number systems)

## How to Use

To explore the code in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/whiteskyyyy/NU-Cplusplus.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/NU-Cplusplus.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific activity folder:**
    ```bash
    cd NU-Cplusplus/IF\ STATEMENT\ -\ reuploaded\ with\ evidence/
    ```
3.  **Compile and run C++ files:**
    You will need a C++ compiler (like g++ or clang) installed on your system.
    ```bash
    g++ YourFileName.cpp -o YourFileName
    ./YourFileName
    ```
    (Replace `YourFileName.cpp` with the actual C++ file name)
